To build your applications the common

# ./configure
# make

can be used.

For CUDA applications, you may need to specify the location of CUDA in the
./configure stage. i.e. on Jarvis the following can be used.

# ./configure --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda/cuda-5.5/

This is build infrastructure for CS546.  This make file has examples for
Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.

To run Pthread, OpenMP, and CUDA applications.

# ./<prog_name>

To run MPI applications

# mpirun <prog_name>
